# Face-Recognition-System-with-Real-Time-Detection-using-CNN
This repository contains a face recognition system that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to capture and recognize faces in real-time using a webcam. It supports multiple users, organizing each user's data in subdirectories. The project demonstrates the application of deep learning for real-time face recognition.
